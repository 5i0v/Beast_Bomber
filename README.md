In discord spammer, you need to enter the ID that is in the link, for example:

# Problems and their solutions

If you see something like this:

![wtf4](https://i.ibb.co/XWNtL0S/Screenshot-1.png "no module named") 

This means that you don't have the library that is specified in the error, in this case: "_ctypes". You need to enter in the terminal or cmd:

* pip install the name of the required library(example: pip install _ctypes)
